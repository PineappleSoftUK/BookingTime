# BookingTime

## Update
Just a note to say I am currently learning/perfecting a REST API system and I intend to change KeepingStock over to this once I am happy with my test case. In the meantime there will not be any further updates.

Booking Time is currently a work in progress, it will be a generic HTML/PHP/JS appointment booking system. The idea will be to integrate this with a new or existing website to add appointment booking functionality. I intend for the system to be flexible enough to adapt to a wide range of services, from vet appointments to booking a meeting room and everything in between.
